* Please document how to reproduce the bug.
* If posting ping output, run it with -v to include more debug information.
* Report the tool version (use -V). Sometimes the issue might be related to the Linux distribution (e.g., cat /etc/os-release).
* Always test against the latest master branch.
* Identifying the commit that introduced the problem is helpful (e.g., via bisecting).
* Document the kernel and the distribution that were used.
* Tests should ideally use network namespaces to avoid interfering with the rest of the system.
